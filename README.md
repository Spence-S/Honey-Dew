# Honey Dew

The eventual purpose of this app will be to send to-do items and notes to
friends, romantic partners, and colleagues.

## Overarching Goals and Core Ideas

1) Write your own todo list.
2) Maintain multiple lists. (Feature not added for V1)
3) Maintain a list of contacts that are addable by email or facebook. (Feature not added)
4) Send Todo items to contacts.
5) Receive responses on todo items from contacts.

### App features
- These are feature not seen nor noticed by the end user
- So far most of the work has been put into building out these secondary features.


##### Many more features are to be added in the future. These are minimum V1 features that I believe are necessary.
- [x] 1) Secure login with e-mail and password.
- [ ] 2) Connect account facebook securely. (In progress - mostly finished)
- [x] 3) Flash messaging/notifications for users, and a message history. (Flash messages done, history IP)
- [ ] 4) Offline and low connection performance
- [x] 5) Full CRUD abilities for todosState
- [ ] 6) User account, editable, picture file uploads(in progress)
- [ ] 7) Account verification via email.(Feature not added)
